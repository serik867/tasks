# TASK SIX: CLASSES AND OBJECTS
# 1.	Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
# Q= Square root of [(2*C*D)/H]
# Following are the fixed values of C and H:
# C is 50. H is 30.
# D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.
# 2.         Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class has an init function which takes a length as argument. Both classes have an area function which can print the area of the shape where Shapeâ€™s area is 0 by default.
# 3.          Create a class to find the three elements that sum to zero from a set of n real numbers.
# Input array: [-25,-10,-7,-3,2,4,8,10]
# Output: [[-10,2,8],[-7,-3,10]]
 
# 4.          What is the output of the following code? Explain your answer as well.
# class Test:
#     def __init__(self):
#         self.x = 0
# class Derived_Test(Test):
#     def __init__(self):
#         self.y = 1
# def main():
#     b = Derived_Test()
#     print(b.x,b.y)
# main()
 
# class A:
#     def __init__(self, x= 1):
#         self.x = x
# class der(A):
#     def __init__(self,y = 2):
#         super().__init__()
#         self.y = y
# def main():
#     obj = der()
#     print(obj.x, obj.y)
# main())
 
# class A:
#     def __init__(self,x):
#         self.x = x
#     def count(self,x):
#         self.x = self.x+1
# class B(A):
#     def __init__(self, y=0):
#         A.__init__(self, 3)
#         self.y = y
#     def count(self):
#         self.y += 1     
# def main():
#     obj = B()
#     obj.count()
#     print(obj.x, obj.y)
# main()
 
 
 
# class A:
#     def __init__(self):
#         self.multiply(15)
#         print(self.i)
 
#     def multiply(self, i):
#         self.i = 4 * i;
# class B(A):
#     def __init__(self):
#         super().__init__()
 
#     def multiply(self, i):
#         self.i = 2 * i;
# obj = B()
 
# 5.	Create a Time class and initialize it with hours and minutes.
# Make a method addTime which should take two time object and add them. E.g.- (2 hour and 50 min)+(1 hr and 20 min) is (4 hr and 10 min)
# Make a method displayTime which should print the time.
# Make a method DisplayMinute which should display the total minutes in the Time. E.g.- (1 hr 2 min) should display 62 minute.
# 6.           Write a Person class with an instance variable, , and a constructor that takes an integer, , as a parameter. The constructor must assign  to  after confirming the argument passed as  is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as , the constructor should set  to  and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. In addition, you must write the following instance methods:
# yearPasses() should increase the  instance variable by .
# amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
# If , print You are young..
# If  and , print You are a teenager..
# Otherwise, print You are old..
# Sample Input:
# 4
# -1
# 10
# 16
# 18
# Sample Output:
# Age is not valid, setting age to 0.
# You are young.
# You are young.
 
# You are young.
# You are a teenager.
 
# You are a teenager.
# You are old.
 
# You are old.
# You are old.
