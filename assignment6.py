# TASK SIX: CLASSES AND OBJECTS
# 1.	Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
# Q= Square root of [(2*C*D)/H]
# Following are the fixed values of C and H:
# C is 50. H is 30.
# D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.
import math

x=input("Enter numbers separeted by comma: " )
list1=[int(num) for num in x.split(",")]
print(list1)
C,H=50,30

result=map(lambda D:math.sqrt((2*C*D)/H),list1)
print(list(result))



# 2.Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. 
# The Square class has an init function which takes a length as argument. 
# Both classes have an area function which can print the area of the shape 
# where Shapeâ€™s area is 0 by default.
class Shape:
    def __init__(self,length=0):
        self.length=length

    def area(self):
        return "The Shape area", self.length

    def __init__(self,length):
        self.length=length

    def area(self):
        return "The Square area", self.length

shape=Shape()
square=Square(12)
print(shape.area())
print(square.area())


# 3.Create a class to find the three elements that sum to zero from a set of n real numbers.
# Input array: [-25,-10,-7,-3,2,4,8,10]
# Output: [[-10,2,8],[-7,-3,10]]


 
# 4. What is the output of the following code? Explain your answer as well.
# class Test:
#     def __init__(self):
#         self.x = 0
# class Derived_Test(Test):
#     def __init__(self):
#         self.y = 1
# def main():
#     b = Derived_Test()
#     print(b.x,b.y)

# Make a method displayTime which should print the time.
# Make a method DisplayMinute which should display the total minutes in the Time.

# 6.Write a Person class with an instance variable, and a constructor that takes an integer, as a parameter.
# The constructor must assign  to  after confirming the argument passed as  is not negative; 
# if a negative argument is passed as ,
# the constructor should set  to  and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. In addition, you must write the following instance methods:
# yearPasses() should increase the  instance variable by .
# amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
# If , print You are young..
# If  and , print You are a teenager..
# Otherwise, print You are old..
# Sample Input:
# 4
# -1
# 10
# 16

# Sample Output:
# Age is not valid, setting age to 0.
# You are young.
# You are young.
